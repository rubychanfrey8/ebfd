Left her message that said essentially: Hi i'm looking for an attorney, i think i might have an idea, will call you next week.  Intake: Husband was transferred to RJ Donovan 12/30/22. He was there 3 months. first was fine. second he got a new celly, but they started bumping heads. A couple other inmates were picking on him. 2018 transferred from Solano to Corcoran. Back in 2019 he got in trouble in Corcoran. Corcoran 2018-2022. Then RJ Donovan. Investigator from Corcoran's nephew was in same housing pod as her husband and approached her husband and said if you give up xyz info, I'll get your visits back. Melissa told him not to give up info. Didn't want him in danger. Said he's entitled to visits and they just needed to wait. Then his celly spoke to CO and CO said sorry we can't move him to new cell. Fast forward Melissa and her daughter saw him March 24 and 25th over spring break 2023. Talked to him when they got home. He contacted her Monday 26th in the morning- said they were being locked down and didn't know how long it would be before they would be able to talk on the phone again.\\nThursday that week she got a call he had passed away (4 days after she saw him). She received his stuff. There was a letter he was starting to write saying \"I hope you haven't worried too much. Lock down due to violence of overdoses. COs did cell search, were very rude about it.\" She feels like someone put a hot spot on her husband. He had an overdose in Sept of last year- he did have a drug problem. Then in March got weed- said it smelled funny. Said someone did it to him. He had another overdose. Gave him Narcan but was able to walk. Not as bad as in Sept. and he said he was drugged. She has a feeling that they're going to tell her his death was an accidental overdose. But she said he was doing really well since Sept. scare. In visits he was looking really good. She thinks someone intentionally did this.\\nWants to know- what's the protocol for cell searches? Do they search both cell and the inmates. Wondering if CO might have passed her husband drugs. Does she need a lawyer to find this out? Feels his celly had a part in this and maybe the other person had a tiff with. Celly was moved to higher level prison in the middle of the investigation. Wants to know if they gave him CPR. Wants camera footage of cell checks that morning. Wants to know what questions she's allowed to ask the prison.

She said the Dublin center is larger and has more supplies but if there's something the client needs and they don't have it in Oakland she can try to transfer it from Dublin to Oakland. She said that clients can come in or a provider can come on their behalf. There's an intake form that asks for some contact and demographic info that a client or provider would need to complete before we could shop (name, number, zip code, income level, race, disabilities, etc.). She said there's no limit to the amount of things a could get there the first time around. After that they will do their best to work with the clients to help them get what she needs.

Below is some information that can hopefully help you with obtaining relative placement. We typically work directly with parents, so if your child (the parent of the children with the open dependency case) wants to contact us directly for additional assistance, they can reach our intake line at 510-619-8227.\\n\\nHere is our website for more information on what we do: https://prisonerswithchildren.org/eastbayfamilydefenders/ \\n\\nWhen a child is removed from their parents, placement with a relative is preferred. When determining if placement with a relative is appropriate, CPS and the court are supposed to consider:\\n\\n\\nThe child’s best interest, including special physical, psychological, educational, medical, or emotional needs;\\n\\nThe wishes of the parent, relative, and child, if appropriate;\\n\\nPlacement of siblings and half-siblings in the same home, unless the placement would be unsafe;\\n\\nThe moral character of the relative and any other adults living in the home;\\n\\nThe nature and duration of the relationship between the child and the relative, and the relatives desire to legally care for the child if reunification with the parents is unsuccessful;\\n\\nThe ability of the relative to:\\n\\nProvide a safe, secure, and stable environment for the child;\\n\\nProperly and effectively care for the child;\\n\\nProvide a home and necessities for the child;\\n\\nProtect the child from their parents;\\n\\nFacilitate court-ordered reunification efforts with the parents;\\n\\nHelp implement all elements of the case plan;\\n\\nBecome a legal guardian or adoptive parent to the child if reunification fails; and\\n\\nArrange appropriate and safe child care;\\n\\nThe safety of the relative’s home.\\n\\n\\nFor more detailed information, see California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code § 361.3.\\n\\n\\nTo become a relative placement for a child, you should complete and file a Relative Information Form (Form JV-285).\\n\\n\\nIf a child is already in foster care and you are looking to become a relative placement, you can file a § 388 Petition. Here are some § 388 Motion FAQs from our website.\\n\\nTo file a § 388 Petition, you will need to complete and file the following forms, which are linked below:\\n\\n\\nRequest to Change Court Order Form (Form JV-180)\\n\\nConfidential Information Form (Form JV-182)\\n\\nCourt Order Form (Form JV-183)\\n\\nOrder After Hearing Form (Form JV-184)\\n\\nAsk the court clerk or self-help center to make sure you have all the forms you need.\\n\\nI hope this information helps and makes sense.

Back in 2019 he got in trouble in Corcoran. Corcoran 2018-2022. Then RJ Donovan. Investigator from Corcoran's nephew was in same housing pod as her husband and approached her husband and said if you give up xyz info, I'll get your visits back. Melissa told him not to give up info. Didn't want him in danger. Said he's entitled to visits and they just needed to wait. Then his celly spoke to CO and CO said sorry we can't move him to new cell. Fast forward Melissa and her daughter saw him March 24 and 25th over spring break 2023. Talked to him when they got home. He contacted her Monday 26th in the morning- said they were being locked down and didn't know how long it would be before they would be able to talk on the phone again.\\nThursday that week she got a call he had passed away (4 days after she saw him). She received his stuff. There was a letter he was starting to write saying \"I hope you haven't worried too much. Lock down due to violence of overdoses. COs did cell search, were very rude about it.\" She feels like someone put a hot spot on her husband. He had an overdose in Sept of last year- he did have a drug problem. Then in March got weed- said it smelled funny. Said someone did it to him. He had another overdose. Gave him Narcan but was able to walk. Not as bad as in Sept. and he said he was drugged. She has a feeling that they're going to tell her his death was an accidental overdose. But she said he was doing really well since Sept. scare. In visits he was looking really good. She thinks someone intentionally did this.\\nWants to know- what's the protocol for cell searches? Do they search both cell and the inmates. Wondering if CO might have passed her husband drugs. Does she need a lawyer to find this out? Feels his celly had a part in this and maybe the other person had a tiff with. Celly was moved to higher level prison in the middle of the investigation. Wants to know if they gave him CPR. Wants camera footage of cell checks that morning. Wants to know what questions she's allowed to ask the prison.   Texted on 9/20 to say meeting with Dorsey on Monday   \n",

She let me know that there are actually two different Family Resource Centers- one at 7066 Village Parkway in Dublin (open Tues 9-1, Weds 10-6, & Sat 9-2pm) and one at 111 Myrtle Street in Oakland (open Mon-Fri 8:30-4:30). She said the Dublin center is larger and has more supplies but if there's something the client needs and they don't have it in Oakland she can try to transfer it from Dublin to Oakland. She said that clients can come in or a provider can come on their behalf. There's an intake form that asks for some contact and demographic info that a client or provider would need to complete before we could shop (name, number, zip code, income level, race, disabilities, etc.). She said there's no limit to the amount of things a could get there the first time around. After that they will do their best to work with the clients to help them get what she needs. They have diapers, clothes, baby shampoo etc.   \n",

We got your voicemail about needing resources to help avoid incarceration that would interfere with breastfeeding/taking care of your son.

She is breastfeeding and hoping to convince the judge not to send her to jail and, instead, let her stay with her baby until the baby is at least 2 yrs old.

Below is some information that can hopefully help you with obtaining relative placement. We typically work directly with parents, so if your child (the parent of the children with the open dependency case) wants to contact us directly for additional assistance, they can reach our intake line at 510-619-8227.\\n\\nHere is our website for more information on what we do: https://prisonerswithchildren.org/eastbayfamilydefenders/ \\n\\nWhen a child is removed from their parents, placement with a relative is preferred. When determining if placement with a relative is appropriate, CPS and the court are supposed to consider:\\n\\n\\nThe child’s best interest, including special physical, psychological, educational, medical, or emotional needs;\\n\\nThe wishes of the parent, relative, and child, if appropriate;\\n\\nPlacement of siblings and half-siblings in the same home, unless the placement would be unsafe;\\n\\nThe moral character of the relative and any other adults living in the home;\\n\\nThe nature and duration of the relationship between the child and the relative, and the relatives desire to legally care for the child if reunification with the parents is unsuccessful;\\n\\nThe ability of the relative to:\\n\\nProvide a safe, secure, and stable environment for the child;\\n\\nProperly and effectively care for the child;\\n\\nProvide a home and necessities for the child;\\n\\nProtect the child from their parents;\\n\\nFacilitate court-ordered reunification efforts with the parents;\\n\\nHelp implement all elements of the case plan;\\n\\nBecome a legal guardian or adoptive parent to the child if reunification fails; and\\n\\nArrange appropriate and safe child care;\\n\\nThe safety of the relative’s home.\\n\\n\\nFor more detailed information, see California Welfare & Institutions Code § 361.3.\\n\\n\\nTo become a relative placement for a child, you should complete and file a Relative Information Form (Form JV-285).\\n\\n\\nIf a child is already in foster care and you are looking to become a relative placement, you can file a § 388 Petition. Here are some § 388 Motion FAQs from our website.\\n\\nTo file a § 388 Petition, you will need to complete and file the following forms, which are linked below:\\n\\n\\nRequest to Change Court Order Form (Form JV-180)\\n\\nConfidential Information Form (Form JV-182)\\n\\nCourt Order Form (Form JV-183)\\n\\nOrder After Hearing Form (Form JV-184)\\n\\nAsk the court clerk or self-help center to make sure you have all the forms you need.\\n\\nI hope this information helps and makes sense.
